# Software Deployment Automation Script

This Python script is designed to streamline software deployments and updates across developer machines within our organization. It leverages PowerShell cmdlets to download the latest software packages from trusted sources, install or update the software, and make necessary configuration changes.

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following command:

**python deployment_script.py**

**Note:** This script requires administrative privileges to perform certain operations. When running the script, you will be prompted by the User Account Control (UAC) to allow the script to make changes to your system. This is expected behavior. Simply click "Yes" or "OK" to grant the required permissions.
